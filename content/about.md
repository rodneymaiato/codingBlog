Hey, I'm Rodneyâ€”self-taught in the software and AI realms, calling Vancouver home. Started coding in 2016, explored HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash, and got into Golang. Love the thrill of crafting something out of code lines, and AI's boundless possibilities fascinate me.

Check out my pic there ðŸ‘‰!

Beyond the digital world, I'm into [analog funâ€”strumming a guitar, drawing, and painting](https://rodneymaiato.art). Balancing the bits and bytes with creativity is my thing.

While I'm busy designing websites for small businesses, I'm all about sharing insights on Hugo static site generator and more. Join me on this tech, creativity, and business journey. Let's create and innovate together!

Got questions, want to collaborate, or just connect? Hit me upâ€”I'm all ears! ðŸš€
