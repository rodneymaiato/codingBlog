**About Me**

Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Rodney, a self-taught enthusiast in the realm of software development and AI exploration. Based in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, I've embarked on an exciting journey to not only build successful small businesses but also delve into the creative and technological wonders of our digital age.

**Coding as a Passion**

My coding journey began in 2016, and it's been an ever-evolving adventure. I've dabbled in a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash scripting, and the exciting world of Golang. The power of creating something from lines of code has always fascinated me, and it's a journey I keep returning to, no matter what other diversions life throws my way.

**Embracing AI's Boundless Possibilities**

One of my greatest passions is the potential of artificial intelligence. I'm continually amazed by the advancements in AI and its capacity to transform industries and improve lives. Exploring this technological frontier is a journey I'm excited to be a part of.

**Balancing the Digital World with Creativity**

While coding and technology are my professional pursuits, I also find joy in more analog endeavors. In between lines of code, you'll often find me strumming a guitar, creating artwork through drawing and painting, or engaging in other forms of creative expression. These hobbies provide the perfect balance to my digital life, allowing me to recharge and explore new inspirations.

**Building Together**

As I continue to build and design websites for small businesses, I'm dedicated to helping others succeed in the digital landscape. Feel free to explore the articles on this website, where I share insights into website development with Hugo static site generator and more.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of technology, creativity, and business. Let's create and innovate together!

If you have any questions, want to collaborate, or just want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you.
