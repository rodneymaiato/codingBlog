If you want to put your email address on your website, it's wise to protect it from being read by bots or crawlers that harvest your email. Your email address can be used for spamming, marketing, data mining, and credential stuffing, ie; used to gain unauthorized access to your online accounts.

I use Google Recaptcha V3 to reduce the risk. I say 'reduce the risk' because hackers are always making advances in their software, so you never know how long Google Recaptcha V3 is going to hold up against them.
