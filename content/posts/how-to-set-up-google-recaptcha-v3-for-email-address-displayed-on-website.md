If you want to put your email address on your website, it's wise to protect it bots or crawlers that harvest your email. Your email address can be used for spamming, marketing, data mining, and credential stuffing, ie; to gain unauthorized access to your online accounts.

I use Google Recaptcha V3 to reduce the risk. I say 'reduce the risk' because hackers are always upping their game. I can't say for sure but I've heard that some bot are smart enough to get by recaptcha.
